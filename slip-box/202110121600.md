While reading take brief notes and record the page number and record the bibliographic information.

- Capture what you don't want to forget or might use in your future writing.
- *Be very selective. Keep notes short. Do not copy. Put it in words you'd use.*
- Each literature note is meant to help you write permanent notes by putting something before your eyes while you write.

Literature notes are permanent to the extent that they are kept forever in the reference system, stored along side the source they came from.
