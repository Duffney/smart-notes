Permannet notes are inspired by [[202110131229|fleeting-note]] or [[202110121600|literature-note]], but are the result of your own thinking and stored in the main slip-box. 

Create permanent notes by reviewing your fleeting and literature notes and [[202110121606-d|elaborating]] on them.

When writing permanent notes, use full sentences, do not copy, and write as if for someone else.

Each permanent note should be atomic, containing a single idea.

The main idea behind a permanent note is NOT to collect and capture every piece of knowledge, but to develop ideas, arguments, and discussions.
