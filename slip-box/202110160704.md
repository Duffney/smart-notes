Add note to the slip-box:

1. Add the note directly behnd the note it references OR add the note behind the last note and number it with the next available number.
> Example: 5 follows 4, but if 5 already exists the name of the note would become 4a.
2. Add links to other notes or from other notes to the new note.
3. Add the note directly to the index or to a note that is already connected to the index.
