Your interests become your projects and your projects are your interests.

Following your interets will result in notes piling up in the areas you should consider starting a project.

However, if you already have a project in mind following your interests turns into active research for that project and the notes will naturally accumulate towards that project.

As you note what's interesting to you while you research other projects will surface as a by product.
