By taking notes as you learn, note clusters build in areas of interest providing a starting point for further reserach and learning.

As you learn about a specific topic new lines of thought, insight, and intersts appear.

Eventually note clusters become large enough that a topic that's worth writing about surfaces.

Smart notes gives you the means to capture knowledge in a system that stores maluable and atomic ideas to be used in future texts.
