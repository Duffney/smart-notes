People who multitask fool themsleves in two ways; they assume that multitasking will improve as they do more of it and they do not compare their performance with non-multitaskers.

Multitasking lowers the **quality** and **quantity** of work an individual can perform.

Mult-taking is not doing many things concurrently, rather it's the shifting of attention rapidly between many things, which fatigues the mind. Reducing the person's ability to hand additional tasks as well as lowers the performance of a single task.
