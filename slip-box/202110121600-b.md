alias: Luhman's literature note
---

Luhman never underlined the senetences in the text he read or wrote comments in the margins.

All he did was take brief notes about the ideas that caught his attention on separate pieces of paper and record the bibliographic information on the back.

> "On page x is y." is how Luhman explained his literature notes.

After he was done reading a book, he'd go back through and read his notes, think how they related to the ideas already in his slip-box and translate the ideas to [[202110121606|permanent-note]]s.
