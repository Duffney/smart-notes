Structure notes provide a *temporarily valid* structure for all the notes relating to a single topic.

Once a topic emerges from the bottom up, as a result of note-taking, a structure note is used to collect all the relatable links within the slip-box. Which turns the structure note into entrypoint.

As your understanding of an area changes so will the links and keywords used within the structure note. Even the name of the structure note is subject to change.

> Structure notes act as a sort of load-balance that sits in front of a collection of notes, that can be updated or swapped at anytime.
