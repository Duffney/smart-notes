Sequences compensate for the lack of topical hierarchical order by clustering notes together that could at some pint become a topic or sub-topic.

Notes that attrach enough follow up notes can become topics with several sub-topics under them.

Once enough notes have built up around a topic it becomes the foundation for future writing.

Follow-up notes are generated by starting a [[202110160702| conversation]] within the slip-box.
